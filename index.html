    <h3>About Me:</h3>
    <p> Hello and thank you for checking out my portfolio! Let me tell you a little bit about myself...<br> 
    Born and raised in Springfield, Ohio by my parents Jon and Kim I experienced a pretty nice <br> childhood.
    We lived on about 14 acres, and a big majority of those were wooded. I spent my<br> youth
    constantly outdoors whether it was fishing, hunting, camping, swimming in the creek <br>
    or just exploring and enjoying the wilderness. When I was inside you could find me <br>
     playing video games or practicing the Violin.  Music was a huge part of my <br>
    life and my sibling's life. I was professionally trained on the Violin since the age of 4.<br>
    I spent many years performing at solo and ensemble competitions and in the Youth <br>
    Symphony. In high school I played for a job at weddings and whatnot and also subbed <br>
    in the Springfield adult Symphony a few times. I went off to college for three years <br>
    which, at the time, wasn't really for me so I decided to join the navy one day. And<br>
    yes I did make the decision that fast! In the navy I was a welder and weld inspector<br>
    stationed at a command which operated and maintained huge hovercrafts. I fit in awesome<br>
    in the Navy and excelled at being a sailor. I made E-5 in 2.5 years which normally takes<br>
    around 5-7 years. I got to travel all opver the world. Some of the places I went were<br>
    Australia, Thailand, Dubai, The jordan river, The Dead Sea, and east africa. I loved<br>
    Seeing and experiencing all these new places. Trying the food, talking to locals and<br>
    exploring made my appetite for travel much greater.  It is one of my main goals in <br>
    the next few years to start traveling. The past few years I have been working HVAC and<br>
    commercial refrigeration. I got tired of coming home filthy and sore everyday and so I<br>
    started looking around at other jobs fields and also school/certification options as I<br>
    have my GI Bill to help if I wanted to partake in either of those opportunities. Through<br>
    some friends and word-of-mouth I found out about coding and also coding bootcamps. After<br>
    a decent amount of research on the school, the topics and if they were for me I decided <br>
    to dive in head first and give it a go. I was scared, I was nervous, but I realized that <br>
    if I worked hard this would be the start of a new and rewarding chapter in my life.  <br>
    So here I am!
